Question 1: Address Of the three nodes 0x602010,0x602030,0x602050

Question 2 part -A:
Real is wall clock time - this the whole time taken by the program including all time processes used by os. Therefore it is higher than the time it takes for program to execute , since it includes some extra tasks which are done simultaneously by OS. 

User is the amount of CPU time spent by the program. This is only actual CPU time used in executing the process. Other processes and time the process spends blocked do not count towards this figure.

Sys is the amount of time spent inside processes done by OS within the process
