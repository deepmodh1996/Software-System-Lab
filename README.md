# Software-System-Lab

During Autumn 2015, as part of CS 251 course; every week, we are given assignments in two parts. One is called "Outlab" and other is called "Inlab". We are given time of 3 days to finish "Outlab" and 2.30 hours to complete "Inlab". Assignment submission is done in a group of three students. Each assignment focuses on specific programming skill like BASH, Makefile, Profiling and many more.
