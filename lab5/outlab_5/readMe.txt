Notes:
	Q.1	Makefile given in sirs code.
	Q.2	
		before running targets;change directory to square_and_add/build then cmake ..
		you will be able to run 3 targets involving executable files without executing make(without anything that is make all)
		for targets involving libraries first run "make" then those 3 targets will work
		after cmake .. if you run make ; you will get executables in build/src and libraries in build/libsrc/src and no file in libs
			(because if these files were in build and libs folder,no use of individual targets)
